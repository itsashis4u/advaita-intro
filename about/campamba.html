Accompanying these fun events, ADVAITA never forgets to spread awareness about social issues through its social drives.<br />And of course, the ‘Campus Ambassadorship Program of ADVAITA 2015 is something to die for.

Our ‘Campus Ambassadorship Program’ is aimed at reaching the above finishes.A student would be selected as a College Representative from every college based on his aptitude, position and flexible communication skills.<br />We are looking at enthusiasm filled students who would become Evangelists in popularizing ADVAITA.
